    Hello! I am a technology researcher and PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www.designinformatics.org/">Institute for Design Informatics</a> at the University of Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>
    My current research examines the work of data annotation for AI, paying particular attention to systemic challenges and frictions, to envision and inform just, equitable futures of AI.
</p>
<p>
   My research builds on scholarship in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Science and Technology Studies (STS) and seeks to shape the design, policies and practices surrounding emerging technologies.

<!-- 
<p>ET-Jekyll theme is based off of <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com">Dave Liepmann's</a> awesome <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> - which takes its style and inspiration from the wonderful book and handout designs of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>.</p>

<p>The differences are subtle when comparing my variation to Tufte CSS, but these changes were made out of personal preference and are not in any way "better". If you prefer the <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">original CSS styling</a> - please use it!</p>

<p>For more information, check out the <a href="/et-jekyll-theme/">detailed example page</a></p>
