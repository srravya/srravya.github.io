I am a PhD candidate in Human Computer Interaction Design (HCID) at City, University of London. Here, I am affiliated with the <a href="https://hcid.city/">HCID Centre</a> within the Computer Science department. In my PhD project, I examine the work practices of data annotation for AI, situating them within the global flows of resources, and labour, to identify opportunities for worker-centric design and policy interventions. My broad research interests lie in building and contributing to socio-technical understandings of emerging technologies and their implications for processes and arrangements of labour in various domains.

<p>ET-Jekyll theme is based off of <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com">Dave Liepmann's</a> awesome <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> - which takes its style and inspiration from the wonderful book and handout designs of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>.</p>

<p>The differences are subtle when comparing my variation to Tufte CSS, but these changes were made out of personal preference and are not in any way "better". If you prefer the <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">original CSS styling</a> - please use it!</p>
