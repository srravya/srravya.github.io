<p>
  Srravya is a PhD student at HCID. Her research interests lie in examining the implications of computing technologies (including apps, data, algorithms and more) for labour processes and work practices. 
  In her PhD project, she adopts a socio-technical approach to analyse the global labours of AI, ranging from model building to data labelling, and identify opportunities for worker-centric design and policy interventions.

<!-- 
<p>ET-Jekyll theme is based off of <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com">Dave Liepmann's</a> awesome <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> - which takes its style and inspiration from the wonderful book and handout designs of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>.</p>

<p>The differences are subtle when comparing my variation to Tufte CSS, but these changes were made out of personal preference and are not in any way "better". If you prefer the <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">original CSS styling</a> - please use it!</p>
